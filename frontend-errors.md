# Frontend Errors Report

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: 404 Not Found on `/api/projects` and `/api/comfyui/servers`
**Error**: GET http://localhost:8001/api/projects 404 (Not Found)
**Error**: GET http://localhost:8001/api/comfyui/servers 404 (Not Found)

**Root Cause**: The `api_router` in server.py was defined with `prefix="/api"` (line 41) and then mounted again with `prefix="/api"` (line 2328), creating a double prefix `/api/api/*` instead of `/api/*`.

**Fix Applied**: Changed line 41 from:
```python
api_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api")
```
to:
```python
api_router = APIRouter()
```

This ensures the prefix is only applied once during mounting, resulting in the correct `/api/*` paths.

### Issue 2: 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/v1/health`
**Error**: Internal Server Error when accessing http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health

**Root Cause**: The `health_check()` method in `database.py` (line 97) used boolean evaluation `if not self.db` which MongoDB's Database object doesn't support. PyMongo raises `NotImplementedError` when trying to evaluate Database objects as booleans.

**Error Message**:
```
NotImplementedError: Database objects do not implement truth value testing or bool().
Please compare with None instead: database is not None
```

**Fix Applied**: Changed line 97 in `database.py` from:
```python
if not self.client or not self.db:
```
to:
```python
if self.client is None or self.db is None:
```

This uses explicit None comparison instead of boolean evaluation.

## Status After Fixes

Both issues have been resolved:
- ✅ `/api/*` endpoints are now accessible (old API routes)
- ✅ `/api/v1/*` endpoints are now accessible (new v1 API routes)
- ✅ Health check endpoint works correctly
- ✅ Frontend can successfully fetch projects and ComfyUI servers

**Additional Fix Required**: After applying the database.py fix, Python's module cache needed to be cleared and the server needed a full restart (not just reload) for the changes to take effect. The auto-reload mechanism detected the file change but continued using the cached bytecode.

## Additional Notes

The application now has both API versions running simultaneously:
- **Old API**: `/api/*` - For backward compatibility with existing frontend
- **New API**: `/api/v1/*` - New versioned API with improved architecture (Phase 2)

The server automatically reloaded after these fixes were applied, and all endpoints are now functioning correctly.

## Testing Results

```bash
# Test old API
curl http://localhost:8001/api/projects          # ✅ Returns 2 projects
curl http://localhost:8001/api/comfyui/servers   # ✅ Returns 6 ComfyUI servers

# Test new v1 API
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health         # ✅ Returns {"status":"healthy","components":{"database":{"status":"up",...}}}

All endpoints responding correctly after fixes and server restart.
```

## Resolution Summary

**Total fixes applied**: 2
**Python cache cleared**: Yes
**Server restart required**: Yes (auto-reload insufficient)
**All endpoints verified**: ✅ Working
