storycanvas-4 - Project Analysis
🔍analysis
The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack storyboarding application. Initially, it established the React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, integrating basic ComfyUI server management. Key early challenges involved resolving frontend import errors, setting up a root API endpoint, and fixing environment variable inconsistencies and CORS issues, especially for local development.

After a GitHub pull, the engineer then implemented major feature enhancements. This included enriching data models for projects, scenes, and clips with detailed prompts and metadata, developing a robust gallery system for generated media, and enabling RunPod serverless integration. The work then progressed to advanced generation parameters like samplers, schedulers, LoRAs, and refiner/reactor options, requiring significant updates to both frontend UI components and backend API logic. The engineer is currently in the process of implementing the UI for refiner model dropdown, reactor photo upload, and ComfyUI workflow selection.

🎯product requirements
The goal is to create a Storyboarding application for music video generation.

Core Functionality: Accept remote ComfyUI server addresses (LAN, RunPod, Modal) for image/video generation requests and display results.
Structure: The application should organize content into "Projects," which contain "Scenes," and "Scenes" contain "Clips."
Clip Details: Each clip needs fields for:
Lyrics
Length
Versions (for comparison)
Image prompt
Video prompt
Timeline: Users should be able to drag and drop clips onto a timeline.
ComfyUI Integration: The system must:
Confirm models and LoRAs available on connected ComfyUI servers.
Allow sending individual image/video prompts to selected servers, models, and custom settings (LoRA, CFG, etc.).
Intelligently set default settings based on model type (SDXL, Flux, Wan, Hidream).
Support both standard ComfyUI and RunPod serverless endpoints.
Generated Content Management:
Images/videos generated for a clip must be stored in a specific gallery for that clip.
Users should be able to select which generated image/video is used for a clip.
All generated content must retain its prompt and settings metadata.
Scene Enhancements: Add a description box and a lyrics section for each scene, positioned above and below the timeline respectively.
Advanced Generation Parameters: Implement UI and backend support for:
Full-size image/video popup on click in the gallery.
Sampler and Scheduler selection.
LoRA weight and support for multiple LoRAs.
Refiner options (with a dropdown for available models).
Reactor/faceswap (with photo upload).
Upscale options.
Perturbed-Attention Guidance Scale.
Clip Skip selector.
ComfyUI workflow selector (allowing selection from server-side workflows, in addition to JSON).
Deployment/Local Setup: Provide scripts for local development (PowerShell and Batch for Windows) and ensure flexible backend/frontend port configuration. CORS should allow all origins for local LAN testing, and MongoDB configuration should be preserved as per user's local setup.
🔑key technical concepts
Full-stack: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
UI/UX: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI for components.
Backend: Pydantic for data validation, motor for async MongoDB operations.
API Integration: ComfyUI (standard) and RunPod Serverless API.
Data Handling: UUIDs for MongoDB IDs, ISO string for datetime objects.
Environment: .env files, process.env/os.environ.get, supervisor for service management.
Networking: CORS policy, ngrok for local tunnel.
Scripting: Bash, PowerShell, Batch for local dev.

Initial setup of /api prefixed routes for projects, ComfyUI servers, and generation.
MongoDB connection configuration and error handling.
ComfyUIServer model updated to include api_key, is_runpod, runpod_endpoint_id.
ComfyUIClient class updated to dynamically handle standard ComfyUI and RunPod serverless API interactions (checking connection, fetching models/LoRAs, generating images/videos).
Project, Scene, Clip models enhanced with fields like lyrics, image_prompt, video_prompt, generated_images, generated_videos, model_settings.
New endpoints for clip creation/management, and a _generate_image_runpod function to integrate with RunPod's specific API.
Implementation of _get_model_defaults for intelligent model setting.
CORS middleware configuration and adjustments for local development (http://localhost:3000).
Added root /api endpoint for health check.
Bug fixes: aiohttp installation, Python indentation, correct RunPod status endpoint (/stream/{job_id}).
GenerationRequest model updated to include advanced parameters (sampler, scheduler, loras, refiner, reactor, upscale, clip_skip, cfg_scale, workflow).

📈current work
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing advanced features related to ComfyUI integration, as requested by the user.

Specifically, the work involved:

Backend Enhancements:
Adding an endpoint (/api/comfyui/workflows) to fetch available ComfyUI workflows from the server (Chat Message 445).
Adding a file upload endpoint (/api/uploads/face) for the Reactor (faceswap) feature, to handle user-provided face images (Chat Message 447).
Frontend (EnhancedGenerationDialog.jsx) Updates:
Modifying the EnhancedGenerationDialog component to incorporate these new features. This included:
Updating state management and rendering to handle the face upload function for Reactor (Chat Message 452).
Updating the refiner section to use a dropdown for models, which would ideally be populated from the backend (Chat Message 455).
Currently, the engineer is in the middle of updating the Reactor section to include the file upload UI (Chat Message 456).
The current state of the product is that the core storyboarding application with project, scene, and clip management is functional. Basic ComfyUI and RunPod server integration for generation (image/video prompts, server/model selection, some basic settings) is working. The application supports local development via new launch scripts and adjusted .env files. The UI is being actively extended to support advanced generation parameters, with the backend endpoints for fetching workflows and uploading face images now available, and the frontend UI for these features being actively constructed. The generation dialog (EnhancedGenerationDialog.jsx) is the primary focus for these UI updates.
